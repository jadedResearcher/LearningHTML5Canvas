Modern Art Clicker:  simple clicker game.

Get rid of set time out.

Each time you click, you put a new rect down. 

Each rect you put down is one Currency (cookie clicker style, no multiplier).

After a minute or so of clicking, you can buy an intern, to click for you.  (set timeout starts at base rate).

Cost of additional interns goes up exponentially.  Each new intern reduces the amount of time set timeout has to wait.

If set timeout is 0, then instead start giving multiple currency per rect.


simple.
